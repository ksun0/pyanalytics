Before contributing, be sure to familiarize yourself with the project objective, as defined in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Getting Started

1. Fork, then clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/pyanalytics.git`
2. Set up your machine
3. Make your changes
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## Pull Requests

1. You may merge the PR once you have considered the following:
* Write tests
* Follow a style guide
* Write a good commit message
* Excellent documentation: files and non-trivial functions must be explained, while function names should be self-explanatory
* Work in progress features should not be pushed to master, instead, in its own branch. Each branch should address a specific repository issue
* Make sure code structure is modularized and extendable, so new developers can easily get up to speed on the software architecture
